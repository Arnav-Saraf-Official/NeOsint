# NeOsint
NeOsint is a python application that aims to provide a GUI interface for a suite of tools. Right now only instaloader works.

## How to use Instaloader (Becase thats the only thing that works)
- Download/clone this repo.
- `cd NeOsint`
- Create a venv using `python -m venv venv` or your respective command.
- Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
- Run the `gui.py` file located inside of the `core` directory. Run from the `NeOsint` directory.\
- Switch over to the Instaloader tab.
- Use the GUI to configure your settings, such as target, cookies file, login info
    - Learn more about the various flags (here)[https://instaloader.github.io/cli-options.html]
- **Scroll all the way down** and then click save your options.
- Toggle on the instaloader on the home page, and click the button under to execute Instaloader.
- (Optional) If you want to save your configs, then scroll all the way down on the home page, and fill out the "Save as" field and click save. If you want to save to an existing file, then choose it in the "save to" field and click save. If you wanna load, just load it.

## Disclaimer
Even though OSINT is completly legal and fun, using this for evil intent is not good. Not only will you face legal consequences, your father will not be proud of you ever again.
